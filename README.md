# Gaussian Noise & Signal Filtering 🎛️

This project was created as part of the *Probability and Random Processes (PRP)* course to demonstrate how Gaussian (normal) noise affects signals and how filtering methods can restore signal quality.

---

## 🔍 Objective
To simulate a sine wave signal corrupted by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and apply digital filters like Moving Average and Butterworth to denoise it.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Google Colab)
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

---

## 🧪 Simulation Steps
1. Generate a clean sine wave
2. Add Gaussian noise (AWGN)
3. Apply Moving Average and Butterworth filters
4. Compute Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
5. Visualize results

## 📊 Results Summary
| Signal Type | SNR (dB) | Description |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| Noisy Signal | 3.19 | Random Gaussian fluctuations |
| Moving Average | 13.3 | Smoothed signal |
| Butterworth Filter | 17.4 | Best noise suppression |
